# hello-world
My first repository

I am not new to coding however I have stopped coding in pursuit of another career, I am now back at it again and having to refresh all necessary skills. 

I have started to code using Python, to begin with as its easier with the syntax.

In future I wish to learn and go back to coding using JAVA/J2EE as I used to before.
